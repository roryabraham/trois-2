                    The schoolhouse is probably a student’s first tangible piece to their overall community. As such, a student’s connection to her school often mirrors her connection to the greater community. Likewise, the way in which that student serves as a role model in said school may also indicate their intended impact on the world. MarGhece Barnes is the personification of those values. As a recent transfer student from the Georgia Institute of Technology, she embraces the role of a young lady in various applications of STEM education. In this capacity, she models the importance of sharing acquired knowledge and the benefits of learning from every experience. She is also unflinching as she carries a flag for women in technology. Again, she shows that learning and growth is essentially a circle in which student and teacher regularly change roles. Recently she transferred from Georgia Institute of Technology and currently attends the University of San Diego studying Electrical Engineering.

                    </h3>
                <h5>
                    Tony Valentine was born in Danville, California, a small suburb of the Bay Area, where he lived for 18 years before going to school in San Diego. Originally Tony attended school at San Diego State University in the 2016-17 school year, but found it wasn’t the right place for him and transferred down the road to the University of San Diego in the Fall of 2017. He currently studies Industrial Engineering and hopes to use his degree to make a difference in the industry with new ideas for innovation in the field.

                    Originally, Rory Abraham was from Los Gatos, California, in the southern region of Silicon Valley. After graduating high school in 2014, he moved to San Diego to play collegiate volleyball at Grossmont College. This remained his primary focus for two years as he completed his general education requirements. Throughout the following year, he honed in on his studies, and transferred to USD after graduating with Honors from Grossmont College with Associate degrees in History and in Social and Behavioral Sciences. While he found his social science education both interesting and enriching, he knew that, going forward, he wanted to get into a more technical field of study so as to more productively participate in the exciting waves of changes of today and tomorrow. He was drawn to USD by their inspirational Changemaker mission, and by the liberal arts education that would ensure his social science education would go to good use. Now, is pursuing a degree in Computer Science with minors in Finance and Mathematics.

                        INTEGRATED IDENTITY

                <h5>
                    Trois 2 is representative of our individual identities combined into a single, collective, us. Trois (pronounced tʁwa) means “three” in French, and is meant to symbolize the diversity and continuity of our powerful and equitable trinity. Trois, on its own, however, fails to describe the multifarious abilities and dynamic characteristics that have shaped our group’s identity. Our brand identity could perhaps be better described by: “Out of three, two!” Out of three members, we have two males,  two California residents, and two people pursuing a degree in Engineering. Three remain in our group after two dispersed. At our shared intellectual experience, our final group of three is represented in two separate photos. While there are many pairs of similarities and differences, the three of us are bound by a collective identity. We share a passion to integrate the knowledge and skills we will develop in our STEM disciplines into innovative solutions for the urgent struggles that face humanity in the ever-changing “unscripted problems of tomorrow.” We share a drive to inspire, to meet our collective future with the intention of making “change that works toward the dignity of all.” We are Changemakers. We are Trois 2.

                    Over the course of the semester, we have assembled into groups to take photographs, documenting significant moments throughout our collective educational journey at USD. We have developed our close-reading skills to study photography and literature, learning to decipher a greater contextual and symbolic meaning from a snapshot representation of reality, be it textual or photographic. Inside each photograph, there is a whole world of knowledge, history, personality, and identity that can be observed, analyzed, and speculated on using the scrupulous lens of close-reading. Susan Sontag argues that humanity is, as it always has been, trapped within Plato’s cave, and that “Plato’s derogatory attitude toward images liken them to shadows---transitory, minimally informative, immaterial, impotent co-presences of the real things which cast them.” In asking key questions and drawing connections with concepts we have studied throughout the semester, our perception of these photographic representations of reality may become more accurate to the contextual, historical, emotional, and societal truth within the physical reality. In performing close-reading, we attempt, within the limits of our ability and knowledge and understanding, to climb out of Plato’s cave.

                                    <p>Tony: This collective experience watching bird singers, hearing members of the Kumeyaay tribe speak, and touring the garden was both informative as well as uplifting. Watching an act of decolonization bring so much joy to so many people is clearly reflected on the faces of each person in the photo.</p>
                                    <p>Rory: It’s great to see so many people come together to honor this space and the Kumeyaay people. Thank you to all the wonderful people that made the Kumeyaay Gardens Opening Ceremony possible, and let this photo always remind us of the purpose for which we gathered.
